#Coded triangle numbers
PROMPT:
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?


SOLUTION:


input <- str_to_lower(str_extract_all(readLines("Words.txt"), "[:upper:]+")[[1]])
euler <- function(x) 0.5 * prod(x , x + 1)
triangle <- map_dbl(1:prod(26, max(vapply(input, FUN.VALUE = numeric(1), function(x) nchar(x)))), ~ euler(.))

scores <- map_dbl(seq_along(input), ~ sum(match(str_split(input[.], "")[[1]], letters[1:26])))

sum(scores %in% triangle) #ANSWER
